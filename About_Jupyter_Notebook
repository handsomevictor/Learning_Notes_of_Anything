# Some recommendations about Jupyter Notebook I think important

# After installation, install this extension toolbox
pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions && jupyter contrib nbextension install
# And you will find all the necessary tools in VS or Spyder can be applied in notebook

# Change the font and page margins
# Go find the css file: .\Python\Python38\Lib\site-packages\notebook\static\components\codemirror\lib\codemirror.css
# Open it with txt reader and find:
.CodeMirror {
  /* Set height, width, borders, and global font properties here */
  font-family: Consolas, monospace;
  height: 300px;
  color: black;
  direction: ltr;
}
# Here between font-family and monospace, you can add any font you want and a comma, and change the color direction etc.

# Change the themes
pip install --upgrade jupyterthemes
# Check theme list
jt -l
# change the themes
# For example: input 'jt -t oceans16'
# And restart notebook
